## Document Structuring Tools

Create organized documentation spaces with hierarchical pages, sidebars, and frontmatter. You define page relationships using simple YAML configurations, enabling automatic navigation menus.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Page" icon="file-plus">
    Navigate to your workspace and select "New Page". Enter a title and optional slug.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Frontmatter" icon="code">
    Insert YAML at the top of your MDX file:
    
````yaml
---
title: My Feature Page
description: Detailed guide on features.
sidebar_position: 2
---
````
    
    This sets metadata and ordering.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Pages" icon="folder">
    Use `sidebar_position` and parent references to build trees. Your sidebar updates automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Search Functionality

Bertus Erlank's search indexes all your content in real-time. You type a query, and it surfaces relevant pages, sections, and even code snippets.

    A[User Query] --> B[Index Search]
    B --> C[Match Pages]
    C --> D[Highlight Results]
    D --> E[Display Snippets]
```

<Callout kind="info">
  Search supports fuzzy matching and filters by tags or sections for precise results.
</Callout>

## Customization Options

    primaryColor: "#3B82F6"
    fontFamily: "Inter, sans-serif"
